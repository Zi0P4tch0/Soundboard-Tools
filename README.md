#Soundboard-Tools

These tools are written in Python.
I use them to generate the soundboard file.

###sbtool

"sbtool" reads the soundboard details from a XML file, with this format:

	<soundboard name="Test Soundboard" version="1.0" author="Zi0P4tch0" date="24/7/2013">
		<icon file="icon.png"/>
		<clips>
			<clip title="Example Clip #1" file="1.mp3"/>
			<clip title="Example Clip #2" file="2.mp3"/>
			<!-- other clips here -->
		</clips>
	</soundboard>

###sbtest

"sbtest" checks the soundboard and prints all details on the screen.
